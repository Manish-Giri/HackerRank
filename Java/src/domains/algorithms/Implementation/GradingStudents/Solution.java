/**
 * HackerLand University has the following grading policy:
 *
 * Every student receives a  in the inclusive range from  to .
 * Any  less than  is a failing grade.
 * Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  according to these rules:
 *
 * If the difference between the  and the next multiple of  is less than , round  up to the next multiple of .
 * If the value of  is less than , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
 * Examples
 *
 *  round to  (85 - 84 is less than 3)
 *  do not round (result is less than 40)
 *  do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)
 * Given the initial value of  for each of Sam's  students, write code to automate the rounding process.
 *
 * Function Description
 *
 * Complete the function gradingStudents in the editor below.
 *
 * gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):
 *
 * int grades[n]: the grades before rounding
 * Returns
 *
 * int[n]: the grades after rounding as appropriate
 * Input Format
 *
 * The first line contains a single integer, , the number of students.
 * Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a single integer, .
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * Sample Input 0
 *
 * 4
 * 73
 * 67
 * 38
 * 33
 * Sample Output 0
 *
 * 75
 * 67
 * 40
